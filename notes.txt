Thoughts:

1) is it really necessary to check if wts=None, bs=None? should a user even be allowed to pass those in? I've never
once encountered a situation where I want to do that, but perhaps it will come up in the future sometime.. maybe I should take it out for now, it just makes the code look ugly, I think...
